# Spot_Analysis

This repository is used to group all cods relating to the acquisition and
analysis of spot patterns and spot profiles using the a LOGOS scintillator
detector

Currently a non-working version

## logos_module.py

A script containing various functions that are used in both the spot qa and
commissioning scripts

## tps_profiles.py

Script to convert single spot images acquired using the LOGOS3000 or 4000 into
numpy array - astropy is then used to fit a single and double Gaussian in 2D.
Plots along the central axis are saved in an excel workbook with linear and log
scale and a difference image between the 2D fit and the raw image values is
included  

## spot_commissioning.py - SUPERCEDED

A script that converts a folder of raw acquired images in tiff file format into
an excel spreadsheet containing fitted plots to enter into a treatment planning
system software

## spot_qa

A script for ongoing qa that will analyse a predefined grid of spots and write
the results to an access database

## Installation

Do not install, please use latest version of the executable when available

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Solution |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| If the incorrect files/energies are used for commissioning this may result in discrepancies between planned and delivered dose - this would be picked up during testing but will add significant time to trouble shooting | Commissioning results will always be checked visually during the full process to pick up errors of this kind |
| If QA test pass incorrectly - this may lead to beam errors not being picked up | All QA tests should be independently checked |
| If QA tests fail incorrectly - this may add time troubleshooting on set | All QA tests should be independently checked |


## Tests

No tests currently included
Perhaps a test with a known data set - ensure consistant output.

## Usage

Acquire images and save into a directory along with the active script which
provides the pixel resolution
run the code and navigate to this directory.
***Choose a location to save the results***

## Limitations / Known Bugs

Currently only works for tifffiles
